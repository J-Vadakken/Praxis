    <p class="hidden">Through this webpage, I wish to communicate my values as 
        an engineer. I 
        can not both sit comfortably and stand proud. From badminton and math 
        contests to my CIV102 course this last semester, I know I perform best 
        when pushed and challenged. Novelty is oft more demanding than 
        well-trodden paths. As a result, I try to ensure I am in unexplored 
        territory. Engineering is hard. However, the innovations and challenges 
        excite me the most about this field. Fundamentally, I would be an 
        engineer who constantly tries new things and takes risks. I think 
        engineers should be ambitious.</p>

        <p class="hidden">During the spring of 2023, I participated in my school board’s regional 
        badminton tournament at the Golden Horseshoe Athletic Conference (GHAC) 
        after qualifying for it by winning the board-level competition. The 
        players were strong, so the entire tournament was a struggle. I was in 
        the loser's bracket because I had lost one of my earlier games. Losing 
        even a single set at this point would mean I was done for the day, and 
        I was already down my first set 16-20. I mounted a comeback and won 
        21-20. The next game, I was down 17-20. I won. I kept coming back. I 
        kept advancing until I made it back into the winner’s bracket and 
        ultimately ended up placing third in the tournament. With my back 
        pressed against the wall, I performed. And I have noticed that I 
        perform better under pressure.</p> 
        <p class="hidden">Last year, after writing a monthly 
        online math contest for an organization, Caribou, I was accused of 
        cheating since I wrote it from home. As a result, I took special care 
        to write it under direct supervision from my teacher the next month. I 
        knew a bad performance would reflect poorly on me. Regardless, I 
        attained my only ever perfect score on that attempt. 
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">Even during my 
        first-year structures and materials class, CIV102, I mounted a 
        comeback: from 60% to 90%, and CIV102 is not a class known for its 
        curve. I have always performed best when the stakes are high and the 
        challenge is great. On the inverse side of things, I have noticed that 
        when something is not that hard, I start to grow dull and bored. More 
        importantly, however, I feel a lot less pride in those achievements. </p>

        <p class="hidden">As a result, I try to be ambitious in the tasks that I undertake, 
        artificially raising the stakes. The pride of reaching my end goal is 
        sweeter when the end goal is in a difficult location. I could list many 
        examples where I learned new skills, because of my ambition for a task, 
        but I can just save time and talk about this assignment. I created this 
        webpage with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, despite not knowing HTML, CSS 
        and JavaScript before I started on this project. However, making myself 
        responsible for learning these new languages has resulted in much 
        greater satisfaction now that I am done with the project. I find the 
        greatest challenges involve learning new things.</p>
        <p class="hidden">I want to be in a 
        world of innovation where there is constant opportunity for growth 
        because of the opportunities available to push myself. In <i>Why I 
        Write </i>, George Orwell wrote: “In any case I find that by the time you 
        have 
        perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown it.” I have a 
        similar sentiment. Once I have mastered something, I know it is time to 
        try different methods and approaches and acquire new knowledge. I can 
        only embrace this mentality in a field that actively encourages 
        innovation and original thought. </p>

    <p class="hidden">Engineering is hard. Fundamentally, engineering is the application of 
        science and mathematical knowledge to solve a real-world problem. 
        Design is a deliberate iterative process meant to solve a problem. As a 
        result, engineering design refers to the iterative process used to 
        solve real-world problems with principles founded in math and science. 
        I know that I would enjoy a career in engineering design as the 
        challenge and difficulty, as well as the great variability of problems 
        available to tackle, excites me. I am incredibly grateful for the 
        invention of machines that have automated the calculation process for 
        us, as it allows us to tackle problems that do not have obvious 
        solutions. </p>
        <p class="hidden">As an engineer, my values mean I will be someone who takes 
        risks and who is unafraid of failure. I think it is more laudable to 
        fail with courage than it is to succeed with mediocrity and fear. I 
        truly believe an engineer must be ambitious and willing to push 
        themselves beyond comfort. </p>
